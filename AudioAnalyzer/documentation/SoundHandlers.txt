Loudness
Type : { Loudness }
Measures perceived loudness of signal in LKFS in appliance with EBU R 128 standard.
Options:
Transform : <transform description> : db map[-70 + 0.691, 0.691][0, 1] clamp[0, 1] filter[100, 500]
    Description of transforms that are applied to values after all calculations
resolution : float > 0 : 10
    Time in milliseconds of block in which loudness is found.
Example: type Loudness | resolution 5
Props:
"transformString" : string that is used for transform option

Peak
Type : { peak }
Maximum of [absolute] value of signal over period of time. Use when you need to know if there was any sound on not.
Options:
Transform : <transform description> : filter[0, 500]
    Description of transforms that are applied to values after all calculations
resolution : float > 0 : 10
    Time in milliseconds of block in which maximum is found.

    If true then subtracts average value of a block before searching for maximum.
    Don't use this option if you want to detect the presence audio output or possible clipping.
Example: type peak | resolution 1
Props:
"transformString" : string that is used for transform option

Fourier Transform
Type : { fft }
Fourier Transform of the signal. Gives you values of frequencies from 0 to SamplingRate/2 (=Nyquist frequency).
Should always be used with Band handler. You can get values directly from FFT but that doesn't make much sense.
Options:
BinWidth : float > 0 : 100
    Width of one FFT result bin. Actual width of one bin can be less than specified value because FFT parameters are adjusted to make performance better.
    The less this option is, the more detailed result you get, but the less frequently values change.
    Recommended values are [5, 1000].
Overlap : float in range [0, 1] : 0.5
    Specifies how much FFT windows is moved after each iteration, with 0 meaning that window is moved fully, and 1.0 meaning that window didn't move at all.
    Values below 0.5 will make you lose information.
    Complexity of the FFT is correlated to overlap as 1/(1-overlap), so values close to 1.0 will greatly increase complexity.
CascadesCount : integer > 0 : 5
    Plugin can increase resolution in lower frequencies using cascades of FFT.
    See FFT Cascades.
correctLoudness : boolean : false
    Corrects perceived loudness using EBU R 128 algorithm. Set to true.
    It is set to default false only for legacy support puproses.
TestRandom : float >= 0 : 0
    When not zero input signal in FFT is replaced with white noise with amplitude of testRandom. Noise is mixed with silence: X seconds of noise, X seconds of silence.
    Use to test the response of handler.
RandomDuration : float : 1000
    Controls duration of noise and silence when TestRandom != 0.
Example: type fft | resolution 100 | cascadesCount 3
Props:
"size" : size of the FFT.
"cascades count" : value of cascadesCount option
"overlap" : value of overlap option

    Name of description of frequencies list.
    For example, if FreqList is list1, then FreqList-list1 will be used.
MinCascade : integer >= 0 : 0
    Min cascade that should be used in band value calculating.
    Set to 0 to use all cascades.
    Set to value in range [1; cascadesCount] to use cascades starting from cascadeMin.
MaxCascade : integer >= 0 : 0
    Max cascade that should be used in band value calculating.
    Set to value in range [cascadeMin; cascadesCount] to use cascades from cascadeMin to cascadeMax.
    If MaxCascade is less than cascadeMin then all cascades up from cascadeMin are used.
IncludeDC : boolean : true
    When set to false zeroth bin of FFT is ignored.
ProportionalValues : boolean : true
    Mostly exists for support of legacy skins. Disable and use FFT:correctLoudness instead.
    When true values are multiplied by log of band width to show larger values in higher frequencies.
Example: type band | source fft | freqList flist
Props:
"bands count" : count of bands as specified by freqList.
"lower bound <integer>" : lower frequency bound of Nth band.
"upper bound <integer>" : upper frequency bound of Nth band.
"central frequency <integer>" : center frequency of Nth band.

Frequency lists
Band handlers gather frequency information based on frequency list.
Frequency list can contain arbitrary list of band bounds.
There are 3 types of bound definitions:
linear: 'linear' <count> <minFreq> <maxFreq>
log: 'log' <count> <minFreq> <maxFreq>
custom: <freq1>, <freq2>, ...
Several types can be combined with | symbol.
For example: log 100 40 10500 | linear 10 10500 20000
This will define 50 bands, first 40 are logarithmic between 40 Hz and 10.5 kHz, last 10 are linear between 10.5 kHz and 20 kHz.

    Lower bound for blur radius.
MaxRadius : float >= MinBlurRadius : 20
    Upper bound for blur radius.

MinWeight : float >= 0 : 0.1
    Cascades with weight below MinWeight are thrown away.
TargetWeight : float >= MinWeight : 2.5
    Minimum target weight of band.
    Weight is count of FFT bins that were used to calculate band value. Weight of single bin may be very small (e.g., 0.05) when band frequency width is much less than FFT bin width.
    Cascades are summed (and averaged at the end) until sum of their weights is less than targetWeight.
WeightFallback : float in [0; 1] : 0.4
    When cascade values are too small they can be discarded despite having enough weight, resulting in target wight not being hit.
    WeightFallback specifies a threshold below which values with weight below MinWeight are accounted.

    Multiplier for a threshold below which value is considered effectively zero.
ZeroLevelHardMultiplier : float in [0; 1] : 0.01
