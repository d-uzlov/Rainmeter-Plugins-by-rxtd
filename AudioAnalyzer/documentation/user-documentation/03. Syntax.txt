A plugin is designed around a central computing point: a parent measure. It has all the descriptions of what should be calculated, and how it is named.
To access this data you can either use child measures or section variables.

Parent measures are distinguished from child measures by Type option, which must be either Parent or Child.

Plugin is quite complex, and so does its syntax. But you don't have to use all the options. Bare minimum versions of skins using this plugin are very simple.

Documentation uses the following notation structure: <opion name> : <possible values> : <default value>
For example:
MyOption : { fancyValue1, fancyValue2 } : fancyValue2
means that option MyOption has two possible valid values, and if you don't specify anything, fancyValue2 will be used as a default.
AnotherOption : float : 10.0
means that option AnotherOption can have any numeric value, and the default value is 10.
There are options with integer values, string values, limited number values (such as "integer in range [2, 5]") and some more complex values.

This plugin heavily relies on option enumerations inside one string, similar to how Shape meter describes its objects, so you might already be familiar with it.
Imagine you need to describe object named ABCD which has properties length and color.
Most of the rainmeter meters and measures would write it like this:
ObjectABCDlength=10
ObjectABCDcolor=black
Imagine you have 10 objects each having 10 properties: now you have to manage 100 lines describing options for just a one plugin. Maybe some of the properties are itself complex and require several options for full descriptions. And each option would have a very long name. Yikes.
This plugin would write it like this:
Object-ABCD=length 10 | color black
Much simple to write and read, infinitely easier to manage complex description.
In the documentation options that use that syntax to define properties are called <list of named properties>. In such a list different options are separated with '|' (pipe symbol) and option name is separated from option value with ' ' (white space symbol).

All options are case-insensitive. ABC, abc and aBc will be treated the same, and if this documentation specifies value Abc, then all three of these will match it.

This plugin supports math. In every place where number (either float or integer) is expected you can you math operations to calculate it.
Supported operations are +-*/^, parentheses are allowed, all numbers are calculated as floating pointer. It you try to divide something by zero, result will be replaced with 0.
For example, you can write "(5*10^2 + 10)*0.7" instead of "357".



Syntax for parent measure options:
Type : { Parent }

MagicNumber : { 104 } : 0
This plugin has an old version which is partially compatible with the new one. To avoid breaking changes while still delivering improved experiance to old skin users, option MagicNumber was introduced. It is used to determine whether plugin should run in the new or in the legacy mode. Always set MagicNumber to value 104, or else plugin will run in legacy mode which have many default values different from what is described in this documentation.

Source : { DefaultInput, DefaultOutput, <device description> }
Specifies device from which to capture audio.
DefaultInput will grab default input device (such as microphone), DefaultOutput will grab default output device, such as speakers.
You can specify an exact device to capture data from it instead of default devices. <device description> syntax is the following:
id: <id_string>
Possible id_string values may be obtained from plugin section variables "device list input" and "device list output" (see section variables discussion for exact syntax).
If you are distributing you skin, don't just set Source to some exact device id, because other computers will have different devices with different ids. If you want to provide user with a way to capture one exact device, create a LUA script that will read ids from section variable and give user some way to select one of them.

Processing : <list of pipe-separated strings> : <empty>
List of processing unit names separated by pipe symbol.
Names in the list must be unique.
Example: Processing= proc1 | proc2

Processing-<name> : <list of named properties>
Description of processing unit.
Properties:
Channels : <list of comma-separated channel names> : <empty>
list of channels that this processing must process of they are present in the audio device
Handlers : <list of comma-separated strings> : <empty>
list of handlers that this processing must call in the specifier order.
TargetRate : integer : 44100
Very high sample rates aren't very helpful, because humans only hear sounds below 22 KHz, and 44.1 KHz sample rate is enough to describe any wave with frequencies below 22.05 KHz. But high sample rates significantly increase CPU demands, so it makes sense to downsample sound wave. And typical modern PC is capable of running 192 KHz, which is totally redundant.
Final rate is always >= than TargetRate. So if you rate is 48000 and TargetRate is 44100, then nothing will happen. If you sampling rate is less than TargetRate then nothing will happen.
Setting this to 0 disables downsampling completely.
Filter : { none, like-a, like-d, like-rg, custom <filter description> } : none
Human hearing is not uniform across different frequencies. To accommodate for that, filters are usually used. They alter sound way in some way. See filtering discussion for details. This plugin provides some prebuilt filters, so you don't need to think about them.
none means no filtering
like-a means filter that is similar to A-weighting
like-d means filter that is similar to D-weighting
Both like-a and like-d will make frequency response roughly match human perception of sound. Like, very roughly, but it's much better than nothing. I personally find like-d to work the best, despite A-weighting usually being considered more accurate for home usage.
See Filters discussion for details on how to describe custom filter.
Note, that any filter aside from "none" will alter the audio signal, so if you want to use Waveform handler to display actual sound wave, then it's a good idea to create a separate processing with disabled filter.
Example: channels FrontLeft, FrontRigth | handlers loudness, fft, resampler | filter like-d

Handler-<id> : <list of named properties>
Description of a sound handler.
Contains handler type and handler-specific properties.
Possible types are: Loudness, Peak, FFT, BandResampler, BandCascadeTransformer, UniformBlur, ValueTransformer, Spectrogram, Waveform.
See description of certain types of handlers for details.

UnusedOptionsWarning : boolean : true
When this option is true, then plugin will report a log warning message if some of the properties in processings or handlers aren't actually used by handlers. If you see such messages in your log, then maybe you have made a mistake in option name, or tried to use option that doesn't exist.

Threading : <list of named properties>
Configuration of a computing thread. These properties doesn't do anything when ui thread is used.
Properties:
Policy : { uiThread, separateThread } : separateThread
Define the way the plugin will work.
uiThread means only using main rainmeter thread
separateThread means that each parent measure will create its own working thread
UpdateRate : float in range [1, 200] : 60
Specifies how many times per second plugin will update its values when running separate thread.
WarnTime : float : -1
Time specified in milliseconds.
When processing time exceeds WarnTime, a warning message in the log will be generated. You can use it to check how much of a CPU time the plugin consumes with your settings.
Negative values disable logging.
Example: Threading= Policy separateThread | UpdateTime 1/30

callback-onUpdate : <rainmeter bang> : <empty>
Bang that is called every time values are updated

callback-onDeviceChange : <rainmeter bang> : <empty>
Bang that is called every time device has changed. This include first connection to audio device.
Events that cause onDeviceChange include, but are not limited to:
There was no device, but now there is
Plugin captures audio stream from default device, and default device has changed
Device settings were changed

callback-onDeviceDisconnected : <rainmeter bang> : <empty>
Bang that is called every time device has been disconnected.
There are several ways this can happen:
You are capturing data from default device, then onDeviceDisconnected is called when all devices has been disconnected, so there is no default device anymore
You were capturing data from some specific device, but this device is no longer available
Device that was being captured is not in exclusive mode
Attempt to connect to this device ended with some unknown error

callback-onDeviceListChange : <rainmeter bang> : <empty>
Bang that is called every time something happens to any audio device in the system.
Events that cause onDeviceListChange include, but are not limited to:
New device was added
Device settings changed
Device was disabled or disconnected



Child measures
Child measures grab some data from parent measures.
Usually child measures are used to retrieve numerical values from parent measure, with optional string value. However, you only specify StringValue=Info and set InfoRequest to some appropriate value, and leave HandlerName empty, then it will only retrieve string value, without any warnings in the log.

Child measure options:
Type : { Child }

Parent : string : <empty>
Name of the parent measure. Parent measure should be in the same skin.

Processing : string : <empty>
Name of the processing to get data from
This option is optional. If you don't specify it, the plugin will try to find processing with specified handlerName.
You only have to specify it if parent measure has several processings with same handler, so that HandlerName doesn't uniquely identify the handler.

Channel : <channel name> : Auto
Channel to get data from.

HandlerName : string : <empty>
Name of the handler in parent measure.

Index : integer : 0
Index of value in handler.

Transform : <transform description> : <empty>
Description of transforms that are applied to numerical values.
See transforms discussion for full list of possible values.

StringValue : { Number, Info } : Number
When Number: string values of measure match number value.
When Info: InfoRequest option determines string value of measure.

InfoRequest : string
When StringValue=Info determines string value of measure.
Usage: same as SectionVariables on parent measure, but without function call
Example: InfoRequest=current device, description
See section variables documentation for possible values.



Section variables
You can get properties of handlers and  information about parent measure using section variable "resolve".
Like this:
[&ParentMeasureName:resolve(<arg1>, <arg2>)]

Possible arguments:

First argument: "current device"
Information about current device
Possible second arguments:
"status" : 1 if everything works, 0 otherwise
"status string" : 'active' if everything works, 'down' otherwise
"detailedState" : "1" if everything works, "2" if there were some unknown connection error, "3" if device was disconnected for some reason (for example, invalid options on parent measure), "4" if device operates in exclusive mode right now.
"detailedStateString" : "ok" if everything works, "connectionError" if there were some unknown connection error, "disconnected" if device was disconnected for some reason (for example, invalid options on parent measure), "exclusive" if device operates in exclusive mode right now.
"type": type of current device. Possible values are "input" and "output".
"name": name of current device. For example, "Realtek High Definition Audio".
"description": specific type of current device. For example, "speakers".
"id" : id of current audio device. Can be used in Source option in parent measure
"format" : human readable description of format of current device. E.g., "2.0 stereo, 192000Hz"
"channels": a comma-separated list of technical names of channels that exist in current layout. For example, 5.1 layout will have "fl,fr,c,lfe,bl,br".
"sample rate": sample rate of current device. For example, 48000.

Example:
[&MeasureParent:resolve(current device, name)]
[&MeasureParent:resolve(current device, sample rate)]

First argument: "device list input" : list of existing input devices
First argument: "device list output" : list of existing output devices
First argument: "device list" : maps to one of the 2 values above. Input or output is decided based on current device type

All three values are not meant to be human readable. Grab them with a LUA script and process before showing to user.
Value of these variables consists of several lines. Each line has the following format:
<id>;<name>;<description>;<form factor>;<sample rate>;<channels>
Many devices have "description" and "form factor" values the same, but there are also devices with different values. For example, my monitor have monitor name as a description and DigitalAudioDisplayDevice as a form factor. Also, form factor is a well known set of values, while description may be an arbitrary human readable string.
Possible values of form factor are: RemoteNetworkDevice, Speakers, LineLevel, Headphones, Microphone, Headset, Handset, UnknownDigitalPassthrough, SPDIF, DigitalAudioDisplayDevice, <unknown>.
Sample rate and channels may also be represented as "<unknown>" for some devices when it's impossible to determine that audio device format.

Example:
[&MeasureParent:resolve(device list output)]

First argument: "value"
Allows you to get number values without child measures.
Second argument is a <list of named properties> that have following properties:
channel : name of the channel. Default name is auto.
handler : name of the desired handler
proc : name of the processing that contains desire handler. If proc is not specified, then plugin tries to find a processing that contains handler with specified handler.
index : integer index of the value of data generated by handler. If index is not specified, then default 0 is used.

Few examples:
[&MeasureParent:resolve(value, handler loudness | channel left)]
[&MeasureParent:resolve(value, proc proc1 | channel auto | handler resampler | index 10)]

First argument: "handlerInfo"
Allows you to get additional information from sound handlers.
Syntax is as in "value" section variable, except instead of integer 'index' you have to specify 'data'. Syntax for 'data' property is handler-dependent, see certain handlers' description for possible values of data.
For example:
Example:
[&MeasureParent:resolve(handlerInfo, proc proc1 | channel auto | handler resampler | data bands count)]


Channels
Different audio devices have different audio channels.
Most common are just stereo devices that have left and right channels, but there are also audio systems with more channels.
This plugin supports following channels:
Auto — a special channel, it always exists. It is usually constructed as an average of left and right channels, but depending on your channel layout there are other possible sources for auto channel.
FrontLeft (aliases: Left, FL)
FrontRight (aliases: Right, FR)
Center (aliases: C)
CenterBack (aliases: CB)
LowFrequency (aliases: LFE)
BackLeft (aliases: BL)
BackRight (aliases: BR)
SideLeft (aliases: SL)
SideRight (aliases: SR)
